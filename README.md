# NoStarchSpider

Inside the NoStarchSpider you will find three examples of how the data that is being scraped can be output and then formatted/stored. These files are:


data_extraction_example.csv

data_extraction_example.json

data_extraction_example.xml


The purpose behind scraping NoStarch was to practice my XPATH targetting and get familiar with the Python library Scrapy, which is what I have used within this project to scrape the data and output in into a readable format. I do not plan on updating the project any further as this was a test run of web-scraping a basic site.
I chose NoStarch as Python Crash Course was the first Python book I ever read. 

As we can see from the data_extraction_example files, the XPATH targetting has worked perfectly. I plan on using the experience I gained from this mini project in much more powerful and meaningful projects in the future.
